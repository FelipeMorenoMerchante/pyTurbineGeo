pyTurbineGeo is an open-source graphical user-interface (GUI) developed in Python using PyQt libraries. pyTurbineGeo allows the users to create parametric 3D geometry for offshore floating wind turbines and propeller structures. Both the CAD and mesh files can be exported from the GUI. The GUI integrates APIs for CadQuery and CD-Editor.
